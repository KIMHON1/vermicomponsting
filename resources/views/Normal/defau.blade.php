    <class="card-text"><p>Vermicomposting is a  technology for converting biodegradable waste into organic manure with the help of white worms,  red wigglers ,  and earthworms. Worms digest just about any type of organic matter and decompose it into manure. Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic waste more quickly.
